1. Add Feature: User can submit bounty request to users currently at the place

### User Cases for **Finding Places**

  1. As a User, I want to find the **place I'm currently at** so that I may create a post for this location.

  **Problem**:  I need to easily and quickly find the place.

  **Solution**: Locate the user and display places closeby sorted by distance.

  **Problem**:  My location may not be accurate enough.

  **Solution**: Sort the nearest results by most posts first.  The user will more likely choose a popular location than not.

  2. As a User, I want to find the **place I wish to check** so that I may view the place's page.
